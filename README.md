# C++ Module 03:

## Overview

This module focuses on the concept of **Inheritance** in object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class. Inheritance is one of the core principles of OOP, enabling code reuse, extending class functionality, and creating more organized and scalable applications. This module will guide you through the basics and more advanced aspects of inheritance in C++.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Introduction to Inheritance**
- What inheritance is and why it is used in object-oriented programming.
- Understanding the relationship between base (parent) and derived (child) classes.
- Syntax for declaring and using derived classes.

### 2. **Types of Inheritance**
- **Single Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from a single base class.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from more than one base class.
- **Multilevel Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from another derived class.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
- **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of the above types of inheritance.

### 3. **Access Control in Inheritance**
- Using access specifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`) to control access to base class members in derived classes.
- Understanding the different levels of access control and how they affect inherited members.

### 4. **Constructors and Destructors in Inheritance**
- How **constructors** and **destructors** work in the context of inheritance.
- The order of constructor and destructor calls when creating and destroying objects.
- Using constructor initialization lists in derived classes.

### 5. **Overriding and Hiding Functions**
- How to **override** base class methods in the derived class (polymorphism).
- Using the `virtual` keyword for dynamic method dispatch.
- How to **hide** base class members (variables and functions) in derived classes.

### 6. **Virtual Inheritance**
- Introduction to **virtual inheritance** and its use in resolving the "diamond problem" in multiple inheritance.
- How to properly use virtual inheritance to avoid ambiguity in derived classes.
